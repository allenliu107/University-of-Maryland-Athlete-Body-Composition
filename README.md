# University-of-Maryland-Athlete-Body-Composition

## An interactive Power BI dashboard used by University of Maryland Ahtletic coaches to track athlete body composition trends over time, helping to enhance nutrition and training protocols.

The University of Maryland has 20 Division 1 teams which encompasses over 550 student athletes. To maximize the competitivenes of teams, coaches use tools such as body composition scans throughout the season in order to help enhance athlete performance and health. As an analyst I was tasked to extract insights by building tools and visualisations that coaches can use to to improve decisions made on individual athletes and the team overall leading to more wins and better records.
